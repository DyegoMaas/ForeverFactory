# factory-net

## Roadmap

- The default factory could have an option to fill all properties with valid values
- Allow configuration by rules
- Allow sequences in numbers and things like email, etc
- Support group configurations (WithFirst and WithLast) in the constructor of a custom factory
- Support multi-level object creation
